Work experience
======
* 2015-2021: Research Assistant (Metal Forming and Machine Tools Lab, Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences)
  <!-- * Duties included: -->
    * Charted and executed the scientific research of two international R&D cooperation projects focused on Industry 4.0 and Sustainable Manufacturing, specifically on smart and flexible production in metal forming.

    * Led and executed process development (specially multiphysics FEM simulation), tool design including GD&T detailing, prototype implementation and optimization of electrically assisted forging products from variate engineering alloys for an automotive industry supplier.

    * Major promoter behind the conception and application of new forging press technology that provides greater flexibility and reduces tooling costs and environmental impact implemented in collaboration with a market leading machine‐tool manufacturer.

    * Statistically analyzed plant performance and developed machine learning models to infer new knowledge from own simulations and in‐process measurement datasets obtained with purposely designed data acquisition systems.

    * Authored scientific articles and presentations.
