<!-- * [Résumé](http://sergihock.github.io/cv) -->


Areas of interest
======
- Engineering design
- Modelling and simulation
- Metal forming

Education
======
* Doctoral Studies (Dr.-Ing.) candidate at Chemnitz University of Technology
* Engineer's Degree (B.Sc.+M.Sc.) in Industrial Engineering, University of Oviedo, 2016
* Bachelor (B.Sc.) in European Mechanical Engineering Studies, Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences, 2015

Work experience
======

  <!-- * Duties included: -->
    * Charted and executed the scientific research of two international R&D cooperation projects focused on Industry 4.0 and Sustainable Manufacturing, specifically on smart and flexible production in metal forming.

    * Led and executed process development (specially multiphysics FEM simulation), tool design including GD&T detailing, prototype implementation and optimization of electrically assisted forging products from variate engineering alloys for an automotive industry supplier.

    * Major promoter behind the conception and application of new forging press technology that provides greater flexibility and reduces tooling costs and environmental impact implemented in collaboration with a market leading machine‐tool manufacturer.

    * Statistically analyzed plant performance and developed machine learning models to infer new knowledge from own simulations and in‐process measurement datasets obtained with purposely designed data acquisition systems.

    * Authored scientific articles and presentations.

    <!-- * Supervisor: Professor Dr.-Ing. B. Adams -->

* 2015: Internship in metal forming simulation (Metal Forming and Machine Tools Lab, Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences)

  * Performed FEM analysis of the precision forging of gears in tubular components for the research project “Near-net shape forming of gear hollow shafts from tube”.

  * Received training in CATIA, Simufact and AutoForm.
